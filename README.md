## Core Ideas

* Display a portfolio of single assets as a catalogue
* Retrieve historical data for the asset over a period of time
* Extend the space in the list to display a graph of the change in asset value of time
* In the base asset catalogue--list--show a preview of the recent negative or positive trend in value
* Login functionality to store asset catalogues of different users
* Make it clear to the user when an asset trends 20% in a direction--time to sell, time to buy--
